📊 **Economist | Master in Finance | Financial Analyst | Data Scientist | Machine Learning**  

I am an economist with a master's degree in Finance from the University of Minho and solid experience in the financial market. I also started a PhD in Economics, which is currently on hold. In recent years, I have shifted my career towards **Data Science and Machine Learning**, applying statistical techniques and programming to generate strategic insights.

I have experience with **Python and R**, predictive modeling, and time series analysis, focusing on financial market volatility forecasting. I have developed solutions for quantitative analysis, financial consulting, and process optimization. Additionally, I created **Provento Gestor**, a web application built with **Python and Django** for managing startup acceleration programs.
